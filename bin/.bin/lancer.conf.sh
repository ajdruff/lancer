#get the parent directory of calling script
#this works because calling script is in bin and its including this file.
LANCER_DIR=$(dirname ${DIR%%/})

#order of inclusion is important. lancer.conf must come after .lancer-conf
#this allows you to change values of .lancer-conf by adding the variable to lancer-conf and changing it to its new value, avoding over-writing 'factory defaults' and leading to git modifictions.

#read variables in hidden advanced configuration file in .lancer-conf
lancer_hidden_conf="${LANCER_DIR%%/}/etc/.lancer-conf"
source <(grep = ${lancer_hidden_conf} | sed 's/ *= */=/g')


#read variables in lancer.conf
lancer_conf="${LANCER_DIR%%/}/etc/lancer.conf"
